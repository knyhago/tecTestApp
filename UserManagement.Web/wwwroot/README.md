üöÄ Key Development Improvements
1.	Introduced DTOs
o	Replaced direct use of Entity Models with Data Transfer Objects (DTOs) for clean separation of concerns and API best practices.
2.	Database Upgrade
o	Migrated from in-memory storage to Azure SQL Database for persistent, production-ready data handling.
3.	CI/CD Pipeline
o	Implemented a CI/CD pipeline with:
ÔÇß	Automated builds.
ÔÇß	Test execution.
ÔÇß	Continuous deployment to Azure.
4.	Dual App Deployment
o	Pipeline deploys both applications:
ÔÇß	ASP.NET Core MVC (server-side, baseline).
ÔÇß	Blazor WebAssembly (client-side, flagship).
5.	Scalable & Maintainable Architecture
o	Structured for future growth with separation of concerns, async EF Core operations, and cloud-ready deployment.
